MinuteMaster - Master Timing & Approach for Coding Challenges

Overview

MinuteMaster is a web application designed to help developers stay focused and organized during coding challenges. The app provides a structured, timed workflow with specific tasks, allowing users to practice time management and maintain a step-by-step approach to solving coding problems. The app’s functionality includes selecting difficulty levels, a countdown timer, and task-specific durations to guide users through a standardized coding workflow.

Problem Solved

In coding interviews and competitive programming, effective time management and a structured approach are essential. MinuteMaster tackles this by:

Guiding developers through seven predefined tasks, each focusing on essential coding stages (e.g., reading instructions, pseudocode, coding, testing).

Offering an adjustable difficulty setting (easy, medium, hard), which adapts the task durations accordingly.

Providing start, pause, and reset controls to give users flexibility and control over their practice sessions.

Tech Stack

HTML: Defines the application’s structure and main layout, including elements for the timer, task list, difficulty selection, and user controls.

CSS: Styles the interface, focusing on readability and user experience. Colors and font choices are aimed at creating a calm environment conducive to focused practice.

JavaScript: Manages the app’s functionality, including the timer, task sequencing, and difficulty-based task adjustments.

Application Functionality

Main Components

Timer:

Starts at 15 minutes for easy mode (adjustable with difficulty).
Counts down, showing the remaining time in MM:SS format.
Dynamically updates per task, allowing users to stay on track.

Difficulty Levels:

Users can select from easy, medium, and hard levels.
The time for each task is adjusted based on difficulty, with harder levels allocating more time for each task.

Task List:

Sequential tasks include essential coding steps like reading instructions, pseudocode, coding, testing, and debugging.
Each task is displayed with its remaining time, guiding the user through the session.

User Controls:

Start, pause, and reset buttons give users control over the timer and session.
Getting Started

To run the project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/ThirDecade2020/MinuteMaster.git

Open index.html directly in a browser or serve it locally using:

cd client
python3 -m http.server 8080

Access the application at http://localhost:8080

Future Enhancements

Backend Integration: Potential future setup for tracking session statistics or saving progress.

Database Support: With the placeholder backend structure, a database can be added for storing user sessions or custom task lists.

Enhanced Testing: UI testing and backend API testing can be expanded to cover all user scenarios.
