# MinuteMaster - Master Timing & Approach for Coding Challenges

## Overview
MinuteMaster is a web application designed to help developers stay focused and organized during coding challenges. The app provides a structured, timed workflow with specific tasks, allowing users to practice time management and maintain a step-by-step approach to solving coding problems.

Key functionalities include selecting difficulty levels, a countdown timer, and task-specific durations to guide users through a standardized coding workflow.

## Problem Solved
In coding interviews and competitive programming, effective time management and a structured approach are essential. MinuteMaster tackles these needs by:
- **Guiding developers through seven predefined tasks**, each focusing on essential coding stages (e.g., reading instructions, pseudocode, coding, testing).
- **Offering an adjustable difficulty setting** (easy, medium, hard), which adapts the task durations accordingly.
- **Providing start, pause, and reset controls** to give users flexibility and control over their practice sessions.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: Defines the application’s structure and layout, including elements for the timer, task list, difficulty selection, and controls.
- **CSS**: Styles the interface, focusing on readability and user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Manages app functionality, including the timer, task sequencing, and difficulty-based task adjustments.

## Application Functionality

### Main Components
- **Timer**: 
  - Starts at 15 minutes for easy mode (adjustable with difficulty).
  - Counts down, showing the remaining time in `MM:SS` format.
  - Dynamically updates per task, helping users stay on track.

- **Difficulty Levels**: 
  - Users can select from easy, medium, and hard levels.
  - Task durations adjust according to difficulty, with harder levels allocating more time for each task.

- **Task List**:
  - Sequential tasks include essential coding steps like reading instructions, pseudocode, coding, testing, and debugging.
  - Each task is displayed with its remaining time.

- **User Controls**:
  - Start, pause, and reset buttons give users control over the timer and session.

## Getting Started

To run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThirDecade2020/MinuteMaster.git
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   - Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it locally using:
     ```bash
     cd client
     python3 -m http.server 8080
     ```
   - Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Potential setup for tracking session statistics or saving progress.
- **Database Support**: Placeholder backend structure to store user sessions or custom task lists.
- **Enhanced Testing**: Expanding UI and backend testing to cover more scenarios.
